Megaline has observed that many subscribers are still using legacy plans and are unaware of the benefits offered by their newer plans: Smart and Ultra. To address this issue, Megaline aims to develop a predictive modeling solution that can analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend the most suitable plan (Smart or Ultra) based on their usage patterns and preferences."
